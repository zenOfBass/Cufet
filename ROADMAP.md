# Cufet Roadmap

Where Cufet is going.

This file answers one question, and deliberately only one. It does not describe what the
language can already do, why it is shaped the way it is, or how to work on it — three other
documents do that better, and a roadmap that restates them goes stale the moment they change.

Cufet is pre-1.0 and may still change. Versioning is semantic: feature arcs bump the minor
version, and 1.0.0 will mark the point at which the language is considered stable.

## Where things stand

The original finish line — **a readable systems language that compiles to a native
binary** — has been reached. Cufet has two backends sharing one front end: a tree-walking
interpreter and a compiler that emits C and invokes `gcc`. Every committed grammar feature
works on both.

The interpreter is the **oracle**. The compiler's test suite compiles each program, runs the
binary, and asserts its output equals the interpreter's. Where the two disagree, one of them
is wrong — it is never written down as a caveat. Either the behaviour becomes precise on both
sides, or the compiler refuses with a clean error. The narrow exception is behaviour that is
genuinely undefined or platform-owned, where there is no single right answer to converge on.

That rule is the reason this list is short on soundness work and long on reach.

---

## What's next

Ordered by what unblocks what, not by size. Two framings set the order:

- **Sockets, POSIX and Windows APIs, and threading primitives are not separate items.** They
  are all "call a C function", so a **C FFI** collapses them into one item and turns each of
  them into a book rather than a language feature.
- **Multi-directional predicate dispatch is not free-floating** — it is on the critical path
  to self-hosting. A lexer, parser and type checker are one enormous dispatch on node type;
  written as `is a` chains, a Cufet-in-Cufet compiler is miserable to write and worse to read.

### Tier 0 — cheap, and closes open edges

1. **Awaits inside tasks.** The last loud refusal inside a shipped arc.
2. **Write up the recursive-structure pattern in REFERENCE.** `voidable` supplies the "or
   nothing" terminator a recursive shape needs — a node's `next` is `a voidable node` — and
   [`examples/arbtree.cufe`](examples/arbtree.cufe) exercises it, but REFERENCE never states
   the pattern, so a reader has to reverse-engineer it from an example. Nothing blocks this; it
   is simply unwritten.

### Tier 1 — usable by someone other than the author

3. **Column tracking, then semantic tokens.** `Token` carries a line and no column, and the
   AST carries `Line` in roughly ninety places. Threading columns through the shared front
   end pays for two things at once: **semantic highlighting** that knows a name's kind the
   way a language server does, and **diagnostics that underline the actual expression**
   instead of the whole line.

   Worth being clear about the ceiling it lifts: a TextMate grammar is regex over one line
   and cannot know what a name *refers to*. No amount of grammar work closes that gap.

4. **A diagnostics tier (warnings).** Everything today is an error or nothing — which is what
   blocks the two items below, plus the dead-capture-write warning.
5. **Style linter.** A layer separate from the parser, flagging legal-but-unclear code as
   warnings and never errors. Intended rules so far:
   - **Nested bare-`it` loops** — shadowing is legal and well defined (innermost wins), but a
     reader loses track.
   - **Changing the current directory in a rabbit that also spawns tasks.** The compiler refuses
     this *inside a task*, where copy-versus-share has two well-defined answers. A rabbit body
     doing it while its own tasks resolve relative paths is a genuine race and therefore
     undefined, so refusing would be over-strict — and would outlaw the safe ordering (change it
     *before* spawning) that the refusal message recommends. A warning is the right severity.
   - The **"capitalise the start of a statement"** guidance the parser deliberately does not
     enforce, and suggesting multiline formatting of large record and object shapes.
6. **Formatter.**

### Tier 2 — leverage

7. **C FFI, including an explicit address-of.** What makes "anything can be written in Cufet"
   literally rather than nearly true.

### Tier 3 — the design mountains

Both need a design session before they can be ordered against anything. Neither is blocked by a
numbered item; they are here because they are large, not because they are waiting.

8. **Multi-directional predicate dispatch.** Watch the no-subtyping invariant. See above for why
   it is not optional.

   It also unlocks something concrete and small: **mixed-type operator dispatch**, and with it
   `matrix * number` scalar scaling, which is deferred today for exactly that reason. (The
   Hadamard product is *not* blocked — it is decided: if ever added it will be a named
   `collections` function, never an operator, because `*` means matrix product and there is one
   canonical way.)

9. **The rabbit as a control-flow primitive.** It shipped as a memory region and everything
   written about it says so, which is accurate but incomplete: **the arena is the substrate, and
   the purpose is control-flow machinery** — continuations, suspend and resume, capturing and
   restoring execution state. A task that yields and resumes *is* a continuation; so are green
   threads, coroutines, and the exception path. One primitive underneath all of them.

   Not retrofitted reasoning. **Two restricted continuations already exist** — `In case of
   exception` compiles to `setjmp`/`longjmp` (a one-shot escaping continuation) and tasks are the
   parallel form — and the surface drifted toward the conception on its own: the recorded decision
   was a standalone `Start a task:`, but what got built was `Have rabbit start a task:`, which
   *requires* an enclosing rabbit, as do channels.

   **The open questions, in the order they need answering:**
   1. **Surface or implementation coupling?** The code and the recorded decision disagree, and
      everything downstream — how `bury`, `unbury` and continuations read — inherits the answer.
   2. **Which restriction?** This decides whether it is buildable at all. Full first-class
      continuations need either CPS-transforming the whole program (destroying the readable,
      self-contained C the compiler emits) or copying the machine stack (nonportable, and in
      conflict with both the sanitizers and the thread-local arenas). Coroutine-shaped ones —
      save state, resume in order, one live resumption — are very achievable and cover nearly all
      the value. ★ **The no-divergence rule decides this independent of implementation cost:**
      whatever ships must work identically on both backends, and a tree-walking interpreter
      cannot faithfully offer `call/cc` either.
   3. **No implicit accumulator.** The original sketch had the rabbit *hold* an unburied value in
      temporary state until used — an invisible register, which cuts against a language that made
      narrowing explicit and refuses invisible capture writes. `Define x as unbury <stash>.` gets
      the same feature with no hidden state.

   **A stash is saved execution state, not a stack data structure**, so it cannot be a library:
   suspend and resume need compiler and runtime support. (The naming is Turing's — the ACE design
   used *bury* and *unbury* for subroutine linkage.)

### Tier 4 — modules, strictly in this order

10. **The `module` interface.** A named interface defining the contract for any loadable thing.
    It comes first because it is the stable seam everything else in this tier depends on, and it
    is buildable well before the loader — which means the loader can arrive later without
    churning what already uses a book.
11. **Separate compilation and an external book loader.** ⚠ Known collision: the bounded
    open-union representation is sound *because* the whole program compiles at once. Either
    feature forces revisiting it.
12. **A package manager for books.**

### Tier 5 — Cufet in Cufet

Three programs in increasing size, ending with the compiler. The ordering is not ceremonial:
this tier's real blocker is stated below as **ergonomic rather than capability**, and the only
way to find ergonomic blockers is to write large Cufet programs. These are the two largest
realistic ones, so they are the instrument as much as they are the goal — better to meet the
gaps across a REPL and a shell than to meet all of them at once inside a compiler.

13. **A REPL, written in Cufet.** Read a line, evaluate it, print the result, keep the bindings.

    ★ **An open design question, deliberately unresolved here:** does it *shell out* to `cufet`
    for each line, or evaluate Cufet with a Cufet-written evaluator? The first is buildable today
    and is a good program; the second is literally self-hosting's front half. Only the second
    makes this a stepping stone rather than a stop along the way, and the choice should be made
    when the work starts rather than assumed now.

14. **A shell, written in Cufet.** `examples/shell.cufe` is the seed: it already reads, parses,
    dispatches and launches, and now changes directory too.

    ⚠ **Blocked on item 8, the C FFI.** Job control needs process groups and signalling a child;
    completion needs raw terminal mode. Neither is in the language and neither should become a
    language feature — they are exactly the "call a C function" family the FFI collapses.
    Globbing and history need nothing new.

15. **The compiler, written in Cufet.** The blockers are ergonomic rather than capability: the
    data model, text handling and I/O are already sufficient, and emitting C is a route a
    Cufet-written compiler can take too.

    ★ The test oracle already exists. A self-hosted compiler can be validated by asserting
    its C output matches this compiler's — a third implementation held against the other two.

### Ongoing, no fixed slot

Dead-capture-write warning (after diagnostics) · Approach B parser-hardening · a formal
soundness proof or a fresh-eyes red-team · a periodic error-message audit for internal
vocabulary · a performance number against C · design patterns as a book · an in-memory
filesystem for the playground.

**A logic-gates book** — circuit composition over `bits`: gates as components you wire together,
rather than the operators `bits` already shipped.

- **Its signal is four-valued, because hardware is.** Verilog uses `0`/`1`/`X`/`Z`; a two-valued
  signal cannot model an uninitialised line, a tri-state bus, or two drivers contending. The
  tetralemma maps onto it exactly — *both* is contention, *neither* is floating — which is why
  four-valued logic is rejected in core (a rival spelling of "not exactly true") and right here
  (the state of a wire). ⚠ **Truth tables come from Verilog, not the philosophy:** `0 & X` is `0`,
  which naive four-valued logic gets wrong.
- **Settle before building:** is a circuit a **value** you construct then evaluate, or a
  **pipeline** you push signals through? Cufet has both shapes; the answer sets the whole surface.

## Deferred — blocked on something that is not itself on the list

These are **not** numbered above, and that is the point rather than an oversight. Everything in
*What's next* is ordered because its blocker is either nothing or another numbered item. Each
entry here is blocked on an arc that has not been designed, or on a use case that has not
arrived — so giving it a position would be fiction, and the ordering above is only worth
anything if it means something.

Nothing here has been argued down. Each states its blocker, because a deferral without one is
indistinguishable from having forgotten.

**Promote an item the moment its blocker becomes a numbered item.**

### Language

- **Ordering by an explicit basis.** Ordering works on numbers and bits. Extending it to text
  and beyond should use a stated basis rather than new operators or a silent default:
  `is less than X by length`, `is greater than X by character code`, a series sorted `by size`.
  Naming the basis is what avoids undefined-collation problems — case, locale and Unicode
  become named bases instead of hidden assumptions. *Blocker:* intended shape only, undesigned
  in detail.

- **Text refinements.** The everyday toolkit is complete (join, measure, convert both ways,
  split, search, find, slice, replace, case, trim). What remains is fancier: locale-aware
  casing (`in uppercase`/`in lowercase` are invariant-only today), title-case, leading-only or
  trailing-only trim, and a character-sequence type — `text` stays opaque, with no
  character-level indexing. *Blocker:* waiting on a real use case, deliberately.

- **Expression-level flow-narrowing.** Narrowing works on *variables* today
  (`If maybe-x is not void: … maybe-x`). Narrowing a value produced by an *expression* — say
  re-reading `the entry for "alice" in ages` inside an already-checked branch without naming
  it — is not supported. *Blocker:* the checker would have to track which expression was
  checked and invalidate on mutation, which is unsound against mutable maps unless done very
  carefully. "Name your lookups" covers the need meanwhile.

### Types and objects

- **Reference-semantics opt-in.** Objects and map values are value-typed. An explicit way to
  ask for shared semantics has no syntax. *Blocker:* its own design session; it interacts with
  the region model, which is what currently makes value semantics free.

- **Fallible setters.** A setter that can reject a value is deliberately not supported, because
  the current rule keeps `becomes` infallible *everywhere*. *Blocker:* an effect-tracking arc —
  a fallible setter would require effect annotations on every assignment expression. Not
  designed, not near-term.

### Tooling

- **An LSP.** The front end emits one diagnostic per run, with a line and a long prose
  explanation, so LSP's incremental machinery has nothing to earn back on diagnostics alone.
  *Blocker:* wanting go-to-definition, completion or rename — the features that genuinely need a
  resident index, and that nobody has asked for yet.

### Memory and concurrency

- **Move semantics at channel send.** A send deep-copies across the thread boundary. That is
  sound, and it is what keeps the two threads' arenas disentangled, but it is not free. A move
  — transferring ownership and invalidating the sender's binding — would avoid the copy.
  *Blocker:* the language has no way to express "this binding is spent."
